16. function radians_to_degrees ,  function that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10 (decimal) string number,
17. function that replaces all the vowels in a string with a specified character, finding out hamming Distance .
18. Reversing a string , Factorial no. recursively , function that moves all elements of one type to the end of the list,
19. function that takes a single string as argument and returns an ordered list containing
the indices of all capital letters in the string,

20. filtering out integers from a list , function which returns the list but with each element's index in the list added to itself, Triangular number sequence,
21. function that takes a list of dictionaries and returns the sum of people's budgets, function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order,
22. Checking if a string has duplicates are not ,  function that takes in two lists and returns True if the second list follows the first list by one element, 
23. function that takes a number as an argument and returns True or False depending on whether the number 
is symmetrical or not, function that sorts a list and removes all duplicate items from it,

24. function that takes an integer and returns a list from 1 to the given number, where:
If the number can be divided evenly by 4, amplify it by 10 (i.e. return 10 times the number).
If the number cannot be divided evenly by 4, simply return the number ,

25. function that converts a dictionary into a list of keys-values tuples,
function that replaces all vowels in a string with a specified vowel,
function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code is even and 
returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.
